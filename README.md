## Notes about project folder
- Place the project files inside your working folder. This repository was developed in a folder named `MANYAR ORIGINAL` (the exact name is optional).

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Node.js
Download and install from: https://nodejs.org/

### 2. Setup the Project
If you already have the files in the project folder, run the commands below from that folder.

```powershell
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the server
npm start

# (Optional) Run with nodemon for development
npm run dev
```

Open your browser at `http://localhost:3000` after the server starts.

### 3. What the server does
- Serves the frontend files (`index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`) and exposes a JSON-based API at `/api/news`.
- The server will auto-create `db.json` with sample articles on first run.

If you want me to rename the folder to `MANYAR ORIGINAL` on your filesystem, tell me and I can apply that change.
